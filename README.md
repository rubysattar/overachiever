## Planning
When brainstorming about this project, I considered that I wanted to experiment with using Django and Python on my back-end, so I wanted a fairly simple project concept with which to work. I kept with the theme of a majority of my projects (education) and thought of something I would want to use in a learning environment: flash cards! To plan out the nitty gritty of the front-end, I used a an online Miro board, a physical white board, Figma online, and regular old post-its.
